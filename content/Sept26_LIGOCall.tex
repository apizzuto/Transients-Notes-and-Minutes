    \item NASA headquarters issued survey (circulated via GCN circular) for EM followup observatories. Asking for as broad a response as possible  \url{https://forms.gle/sdUZG3bvr59SgKB78}
    \item 38 alerts, 7 retractions in O3. Mean number of alerts (not retracted 5.3 +/- 2.3 per month)
    \item $>$80\% for at least 2 detector duty cycle (44.1 for triple detector)
    \item Since last call: 6 BBH, 2 Possible BNS (1/4.5 years, 1/8 months), 1 NSBH (FAR 1/8.5 years), 1 MassGap (FAR 1 / $10^{10}$ years)
    \item 3 retractions since august (latencies: 20 min, 102 min, 26 min)
    \item Preliminary (Initial) alerts issued on average ~9 minutes (36 minutes) after event
    \item KAGRA still 3.5 orders of magnitude away from ~1 Mpc binary sensitivity range
    \item Commissioning break 2019-10-01 15:00:00 - 2019-11-01 15:00:00. New O3 end date April 30, 2020
    \item Revised "Prospects for Observing and Localizing Gravitational-Wave Transients with Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA" at \url{https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0670} with new sensitivities and observing schedules, etc.
    \item \texttt{fits} files now have a version suffix to make them unique, explained in updated (version 11) User Guide: \url{https://emfollow.docs.ligo.org/userguide/}
    \item Question about if events detected in EM will lead to combined skymaps: joint-skymaps and combined significances are not yet automated, but pipelines are built to do this. As of now, human would send out circular, in the future, should be sent out in automated RAVEN pipeline
    \item Two papers in progress on specific mergers: S190425z (BNS candidate) and S190521g (interesting BBH, quote: ``I don't think I can say any more''). 
    \item Gravitational-wave Transient Catalog update based on O3a, plus companion papers. Release target April 2020
    \item Team looking at science case for a dedicated paper for S190814bv
