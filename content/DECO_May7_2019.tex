\chapter{May 7, 2019: Meeting Minutes}

\subsubsection{Problems with Classification}
Justin's scripts have been working on and off. The crash seems to be related to a matplotlib-py2-v1 error. Justin might switch over to py2-v3.

Matt's scripts also seems to be broken. It looks like an hdf5 error.

I'm trying to run the classification script, where there are 2,033 unclassified events. If I get this working one time, then I can try getting a \texttt{cron} job working, then once Matt and I verify that, we can look into transitioning everything over (including the permissions on the master files). The script ran successfully, so Matt and I are going to move my copy of the classifications to \texttt{net/deco} and Matt will move his old files to a \texttt{backup/safe} location.

Google might require payment for the map thing. I'll touch base with David to see if he might know

\subsubsection{Airflow}

We also talked a bit about Airflow. James mentioned that PyCon is ongoing and recommended the talk (``Building data pipelines in Python: Airflow vs. script soup''). For starters, we might want to start with a Slack webhook that can message me/Justin whenever something breaks. I'll work on this ASAP.

\subsubsection{MC and Irradiation Measurements}

I showed my slides for Justin's class and we discussed putting in some material on the MC or the measurements into the proceedings.
