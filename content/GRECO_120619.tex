\subsection{Systematic studies from offline analysis: Mia}
Mia showed some plots highlighting systematic studies. Using systematic sets, 12\% DOM efficiency, just grabbing most conservative sets, are the fluctuations statistical (Markus), Michael says statistical but also limited simulation, all plots on page want approval

\subsection{Novae Update: Alex}
Make available in numpy files, send michael the link to the model file and script to do the processing

\subsection{Finalized(?) Dataset: Michael}
Pegleg wants to fit close to seeds, there were problems with true vertex being away from reco, so Michael changed bounds but then things crashed. Rerunning on OSG (~4000 nodes maybe 1000 at MSU), reprocessing should only take about 2 days for data. For MC, 300,000 for each flavor by about the end of next week. Conversatioin about per flavor or all flavor numu
