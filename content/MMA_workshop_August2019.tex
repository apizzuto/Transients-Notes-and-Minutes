\section{Francis Talk}
another great Francis neutrino talk. Didn't take notes

\section{Colby Haggerty, Plasma Physics and Particle Acceleration}
\subsection{Plasma Physics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Collection of charged paticles that have a collective behavior, Debye length: $$\lambda_D = (kT_e / 4\pi n e^2)^{1/2}$$
    \item Collective effects dominate when there are more than a critical number of particles, $N_D$.
    \item Once plasma condition is met, stuff is governed by MHD equations (continuity, force / momentum, etc.)
    \item Great schematic on Fermi acceleration in the talk
    \item First order is consecutive head on collisions, but it's hard to do unless you have a structured system, uncorrelated and it washes out. Second order is slower but does fine with unstructured systems because head on collisions are preferred (more likely to hit something coming towards you)
    \item Also good Hillas criterion plot
    \item Regardless of how powerful a schock is, the compression ratio asymptotes to 4
    \item And another great diffusive shock acceleration, shows where $E^{-2}$ comes from, with just one approximation. In fraction for $q$, it should be $2v_3$ in the numerator 
\end{itemize}
