\chapter{Analysis Call: October 17, 2019}

Just taking some extra notes beyond the minutes because Justin wasn't able to make the call and the TXS topic is important.

Will's slides were a slightly expanded version of the \texttt{nu-sources} call slides. Main new checks include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item comparisons of sensitivity for the same data taking period (Slide 3)
    \item Turn \texttt{v3} into \texttt{v2} iteratively instead of going the other way around (Slide 8)
    \item Scatter plots of weights (broken down into energy and spatial weights) between \texttt{v2} and \texttt{v3} (slide 9)
    \item Cross-checks with northern tracks (slides 10,11)
\end{itemize}

\section{Discussion}
\textbf{Technical differences between Northern Tracks and PS tracks}: Rene: the energy estimator is different between the two samples (northern tracks and ps tracks), and a different energy estimate can affect the directional reconstruction. But Jakob says that the energy is estimated afterwards, so it shouldn't have an effect. Rene says SplineMPE with max settings there is an energy dependence. Northern tracks also excludes the DeepCore DOMs for the input pulse map

Anna suggested making the plots that show in the same figure how the events move in one plot instead of on two sets of slides

Anna asked for Diffuse experts to get in contact with Will because they know the sample better.
