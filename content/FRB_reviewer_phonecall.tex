\chapter{Phonecall with FRB Paper Reviewers, March 29, 2019}

Kevin didn't show up. As we waited, Segev asked what comments are going to be hard to address. Ali said that a lot of the comments from Kevin are stylistic. Brevity was intended, because there are a lot of previous papers.

Lutz said that the comments in the Supernova section are good and should be followed. He also does not like using the Lawrence-Livermore model, and thinks that the limits should be presented in a more general context. Erin agrees with that. Lutz says that you could leave the limit in terms of some $\alpha$ parameter, but Justin likes having a quantitative limit. Lutz says that this can still be done if you assume certain widths and energies, but then readers can reinterpret for different widths and energies. 

Juanan advocates for settling these issues before going to collaboration review. Other comments from Juanan:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Confusion around the different numbers of FRBs
    \item Requests a sentence maybe about the repeater
\end{itemize}

Ali said that he and Sam could probably post a new version on Monday. Reviewers will aim to give feedback by the end of next week. Erin recognizes changes the SNDAQ limit might take some more time, Juanan is fine if that work is still ongoing as the paper goes into Collaboration review.
